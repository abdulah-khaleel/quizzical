# Quizzical

I built a small quizz app built with React as part of the [Learn React ](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/) course by Bob Ziroll on Scrimba.

## About the Game

The app pulls 5 random questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API and presents them to the player. Results with correct answers are shown at the end and the player can reply with a new set of random questions.
